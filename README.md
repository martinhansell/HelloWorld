 My Hello World effort!

This is a change I am going to make in the readme-edits file which will eventually be merged into the master repo.

Let me tell you a few things about myself.

Firstly, I am very happy to say that I am an international travller-type person... by that I mean I not only love travelling (althought sadly have done far too little) but that also I have travelled, lived and worked abroad (away from my native England) for 19 years now. That's fantastic. Does that mean I'm starting to miss my homeland... I would say yes! But there is far more to this story that just the parts that are not there!
