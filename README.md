 My Hello World effort!

This is a change I am going to make in the readme-edits file which will eventually be merged into the master repo.

Let me tell you a few things about myself.

Firstly, I am very happy to say that I am an international travller-type person... by that I mean I not only love travelling (althought sadly have done far too little) but that also I have travelled, lived and worked abroad (away from my native England) for 19 years now. That's fantastic. Does that mean I'm starting to miss my homeland... I would say yes! But there is far more to this story that just the parts that are not there!

Now I'm going to slip in a new paragraph in-between one and two to see what that does to the whole thing!

So there's the second, and perhaps far more important (such that it should have been the first!) thing to grasp about me - and that is... "I belong to God!" Yup - that's right! My whole life belongs to the One who made me. There is none other that can compare to the Lord of Glory, and the One whom I long to meet face to face in due course... Of course I know that'll be a very scary moment! So I think I need a little more time to get myself prepared for that. You know what they say about how long the wicked live, right?

So there is a third item on my "get to know me" list!
